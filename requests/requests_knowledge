HTTP methods - allowing to perform different actions when making an HTTP request


# GET Request:




Other HTTP Methods
>>> requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data={'key':'value'})
>>> requests.put('https://httpbin.org/put', data={'key':'value'})
>>> requests.delete('https://httpbin.org/delete')
>>> requests.head('https://httpbin.org/get')
>>> requests.patch('https://httpbin.org/patch', data={'key':'value'})
>>> requests.options('https://httpbin.org/get')


For each method, you can inspect their responses in the same way you did before:

>>> response = requests.head('https://httpbin.org/get')
>>> response.headers['Content-Type']
'application/json'

>>> response = requests.delete('https://httpbin.org/delete')
>>> json_response = response.json()
>>> json_response['args']
{}


Headers, response bodies, status codes, and more are returned in the Response for each method.




POST, PUT, and the less common PATCH requests
-- their data through the message body rather than through parameters in the query string
