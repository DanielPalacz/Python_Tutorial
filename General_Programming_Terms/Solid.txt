set of 5 rules about Object Oriented Programming
initiated by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)



"S" - Single Responsibility principle
Class should have only 1 Responsibility

"O" - Open/closed principle
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification

"L" - Liskov substitution principle
It is about Functions referring to Base Classes.
Those functions should be able to use also objects inheriting from Base Classes, BUT without knowing in details those objects.

"I" - Interface segregation principle
Many dedicated interfaces are better than one general.

"D" - Dependency inversion principle
High level modules should not depend from low-level modules. Dependency between them should come from abstraction.
